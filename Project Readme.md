# **The Boundary Line Project between Science and the Humanities (AI and Responsibility)**

# **理系と人文知の境界線プロジェクト（AIと責任）**

## **Overview**

This project attempts to redefine and structure the blurred boundary between "meaning" and "responsibility" amidst the advancement of Generative AI, by fusing insights from the humanities (specifically Jungian analytical psychology) with an engineering approach (commitment protocols).

Addressing the phenomenon where responsibility evaporates under the guise of "interpretive ambiguity" (**Ghost Drift**), this project proposes that **"Boundary Fixation"** is the sole means to embed responsibility within meaning.

**— Non-Retroactive Accountability When Meaning Is Committed —**

* **Online Version:** [View Full Protocol](https://ghostdrifttheory.github.io/jung-boundary-accountability/)  
* **Filename:** ghost\_drift\_protocol.html  
* **Format:** Standalone HTML (Academic Paper Style)  
* **Status:** Conceptual Framework (June 2025\)

#### **Purpose of the Document**

A white paper that conceptually reinterprets Jungian concepts such as "Individuation" and "Shadow" away from the contexts of introspection or therapy, repurposing them as an **"engineering boundary protocol for fixing the locus of responsibility in AI systems."**

#### **Core Thesis**

"Jungian meaning becomes accountable only when it is committed to a boundary."

## **Key Concepts**

1. **Ghost Drift**  
   * The phenomenon where the criteria forming the basis of a decision are rewritten retroactively after the result is known, causing the locus of responsibility to evaporate.  
   * This project treats this as a "structural defect" and aims to prevent it through mathematical modeling and protocols.  
2. **Boundary Fixation**  
   * An engineering requirement to prevent interpretation from ending merely as "Projection."  
   * By irreversibly fixing (Committing) the scope, assumptions, and verification rules (**Boundary Artifact**) prior to evaluation or output, post-hoc evasion of responsibility is prevented.  
3. **Responsibility Residue**  
   * A structural classification for Rebuttals.  
   * By forcing a choice between "proposing an alternative boundary to inherit responsibility (**Bounded**)" or "being recorded as a boundary-free objection (**Boundary-free**)," the system prevents hollowing out caused by irresponsible criticism.
