# The Boundary Line Project between Science and the Humanities (AI and Responsibility)

# 理系と人文知の境界線プロジェクト（AIと責任）

## Overview

This project explores how **meaning** can carry **responsibility** in the era of Generative AI.
It frames “responsibility evaporation” under interpretive ambiguity (**Ghost Drift**) as a *structural defect*, and proposes **Boundary Fixation** as the core principle: meaning becomes accountable only when its evaluation surface is fixed **before** outcomes are known.

This repository publishes **conceptual frameworks** and **research artifacts** for scholarly discussion.

### Jung as a Boundary Protocol

**— Non-Retroactive Accountability When Meaning Is Committed —**

* Online: https://ghostdrifttheory.github.io/jung-boundary-accountability/
* File: `ghost_drift_protocol.html`
* Status: Conceptual Framework (June 2025)

**Purpose**

A white paper that reinterprets Jungian concepts (e.g., individuation, shadow, projection) as *structural descriptors* for accountability failures, and proposes a boundary-first framework where disagreement cannot dissolve responsibility.

**Core Thesis**

> Jungian meaning becomes accountable only when it is committed to a boundary.

## Key Concepts (Conceptual)

* **Ghost Drift**: When evaluation criteria are retroactively rewritten after outcomes are observed, causing responsibility to evaporate.
* **Boundary Fixation**: The principle that scope, assumptions, and checks must be fixed *before* evaluation; otherwise claims remain non-binding.
* **Responsibility Residue**: Disagreement must be expressed in a form that preserves where responsibility sits; objections that do not specify an alternative locus remain recorded as such.
